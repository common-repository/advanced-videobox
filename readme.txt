== Description ==

With this plugin you can add videos to your sidebar (or any other widgetized area of your site). Just copy and paste code of the video into the Advanced Video widget.
The Youtube's original video code doesn't pass W3C validation. The filtered video code of the Advanced Videobox will keep your site XHTML valid.
The plugin is easily customizable through widget panel. This plugin is ideal for music, tutorial, ads videos. Check for more on <a href="http://wptom.com/wordpress/plugins/advanced-videobox/">the plugin's page</a>
